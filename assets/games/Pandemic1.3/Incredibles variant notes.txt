THE INCREDIBLES VARIANT
     To play Pandemic with the Incredibles variant, use 2-4 of the Incredibles roles in the Roles 
window (recommended with 4 roles and 4 epidemics). Within the Setup window open, right-click on
the Incredibles Special Event cards, choose "Draw multiple cards", type in "5", then drag them
over to the Player Cards. Right-click on those cards to "Shuffle" them and then deal them out 
and continue as usual from there.

BACKGROUND
     The Underminer has resurfaced again after his previous scheme to destroy the world with his army 
of Gilgenbots was foiled by The Incredibles and Frozone. This time, he has created a new kind of robot 
that self-replicates, called CloneBots. With his CloneBots spreading pollution around the world, the 
Underminer’s evil plans may succeed after all. 
     The Underminer has built CloneBot replicating machines in several of the major cities of the world.
There is always the danger of CloneBots spawning more of their own kind, especially when several of 
them are together in one city, which can cause a "CloneBot Spawn" to occur. With each CloneBot Spawn, 
the world will grow more polluted and face the possible extinction of all living creatures.
     The Underminer has developed four separate models of the CloneBots in different parts of the world, 
each with its own unique programming code. He also has CloneBot Interface Stations located in each city 
which allow for teleportation between each other and special connections to the CloneBots’ programming. 
Only one CloneBot Interface Station has been discovered so far, in Atlanta, but the others can be 
located with some effort. The Incredibles must work together to destroy the CloneBots before they 
spread too widely and they must discover the programming codes for each robot model to shut them all 
down at CloneBot interface stations.

GAMEPLAY
   Play exactly as per the normal rules of Pandemic. To win, discover the four programming codes 
before running out of Player Cards or before 8 CloneBot Spawns occur or before one color of CloneBots 
is entirely on the board.

For purposes of the theme and with reference to some of the new cards:
   Drive/Ferry actions are called Move actions. 
   The Infection Phase is called the Replication Phase. 
   An Epidemic is called a CloneBot Expansion.
   An Outbreak is called a CloneBot Spawn. 
   Cures are CloneBot Programming Codes. 
   Eradication is CloneBot Deactivation.
   A Treat Disease action is called a Destroy CloneBot action.
   A Research Center is called a CloneBot Interface Station.


NOTES ON THE ROLES:

   Mr. Incredible: He is the same as The Medic in all senses.

   Elastigirl: Her ability to destroy a CloneBot in an adjacant city is always limited to one per 
action, once per turn (i.e. she still cannot remove more than one using that ability even when that 
color’s deactivation code has been discovered). For her Mom Power ability, she can only move other 
players to her location, not any other type of movement (a la The Dispatcher).
   
   Violet: Violet's Force Field ability is in effect no matter whose turn it is.

   Dash: Dash is not required to move two spaces for each action, but when he does move two spaces 
for one Move action, he must complete that movement before taking any other actions.

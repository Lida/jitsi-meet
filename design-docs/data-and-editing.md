We want to be able to import existing board game data from other sources. The most available one right now is from Vassal and there are sources we can view to figure out how to parse the data.

The editor environment is meant to import and create pieces that will then be created and placed onto the play space.

We also need to record actions and allow playback. We need it anyways for undoing player actions.
